# Experiment 2

Create a student class and write the functions for the following:

1. Display Student Name, age of student by accepting  
   date of birth as parameter (DD-MM-YYYY or YYYYMM-DD) using "Date" Class.  
   The above code should be pushed to the new GitHub  
   repository for the "main" branch.

2. Create a class to display the courses of each semester and  
   marks obtained for each course. The same must be pushed to  
   be a new branch "student_course_information", once the  
   functionalities of "Student" and "Student Courses" class are  
   executed successfully, the new branch should be merged to  
   the "main" branch.
